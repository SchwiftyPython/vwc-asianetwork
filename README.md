# vwc-asianetwork

This is meant to supplement a project by a team of students and professors at Virginia Wesleyan College. 
The project is funded by ASIANetwork and is a part of the Student-Faculty Fellows Program. Part of our proposal
included a collection of media gathered during a three week excursion to various world heritage sites in Shanxi Province,
China. So far, it is a few picture galleries and a way to upload media.

V.1.1 Changes

-Can post pictures with title, description and location to different galleries. 

-Added links to direct each picture to a page.

-Brand new description box to allow a variety of text formats
